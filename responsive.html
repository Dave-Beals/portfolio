        <h2>Responsive Web Design to the Rescue</h2>
          <p>With the endless variety of options through which a user can view a webpage,
          responsive web design maximizes how effective your website can be to all users.
          Rather than designing separate website options for computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.,
          a single website option that incorporates responsive design can retrieve information
          about the user and adapt itself. The website can retrieve the device size and adjust
          the layout, sizes of images and fonts, and prioritize certain content when viewed on a mobile
          device or the user shrinks the browswer window.</p>
          <p>The prioritization of content is an especially important component of responsive
          design. A smaller screen means less real estate in the browser for text and images, and
          so the layout needs to adapt to keep font at a readible size, which is especially. Some of the methods
          for achieving this can be reducing image size and prominence, consolidate layout columns into a
          longer scrolling main column, and collapsing menus into dropdowns. Incorporating these
          concepts into the design means the users doesn't need to make do with websites that are
          difficult to read or unintuitive to navigate and use.</p>
